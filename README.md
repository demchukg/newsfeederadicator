Hi everyone! 👋
This is a repository for a Google Chrome extension that replaces your news feed with a short motivational message.

This little micro-product is part of my learning process in using “AI” for programming.
My background is in product design and management, and this extension is my very first experience building a product from scratch.

I plan to keep improving the extension while learning programming along the way. Next up: Harvard’s CS50, and then diving deeper into programming fundamentals.

The extension is live and your can download it from Chrome Web Store:

The extension still has some bugs that I’ll fix later.

Thanks for your attention, and have a great day! ☕️
